GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically intended to permit
 linking from non-(L)GPLed programs.

 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
 shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
 work, a derivative of the program and the library. The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits linking with the library only
 if the combined work is released under the terms of the General Public
 License. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax conditions
 for linking other code with the library.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
 former contains code derived from the library, the latter may contain
 code that simply uses the library through its published interfaces.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License.

  "You" and "your" refer to the licensee, or recipient of rights under this License.

  A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative
  work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library
  or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
  into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
  limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it.

1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder or otherwise stating that it may
be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License.
The "Library", below, refers to such a program or work.

2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Library a copy of this License along with the Library.

3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 2 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
     the files and the date of any change.

  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties
     under the terms of this License.

  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
     supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument
     passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure
     that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility
     still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative work) in object code
or executable form under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above provided that you accompany it
with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work
with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".
Such a work, in isolation, is not subject to the terms of this License, provided that you do not
incorporate parts of the Library into the work. However, linking a "work that uses the Library"
with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the Library". The executable is therefore
covered by this License. This License permits you to distribute such executables under terms of
your choice, provided that you do both of the following:

  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the executable that the Library is used in it and
     that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

  b) Accompany the executable with a copy of the GNU Lesser General
     Public License and the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library.

6. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
combined library, provided that the separate portions of the combined library are clearly marked
and accompanied by terms that permit the recipients to access and modify the portions covered by
this License.

7. You may use the Library in nonfree programs, provided that you comply with the terms of this
License and that you release the portions of the Library that are modifications of the Library
under this License. If you link a nonfree program with the Library, the distributor of the resulting
executable must provide the recipient with the rights to run and modify the Library portion and to
reverse engineer the executable for debugging those modifications.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Library
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

9. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source
of the work is not available for anyone to copy, you must either (a) arrange to provide the source,
or (b) ensure that the patent license permits everyone to copy and modify the source.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link, and modify the Library subject
to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
of the rights granted herein.

11. If the distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as compliance
with the requirement to provide the source code.

12. You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.

13. If you modify the Library, you may extend the permissions granted by this License to your modifications,
but you are not required to do so.

14. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you are permitted to link or combine the Library
with certain specified files or works that are licensed under compatible terms; see the full license for
exact compatibility details.

NO WARRANTY

The Library is provided without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the full text of the GNU Lesser General Public License for details.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be available under the GNU Lesser General Public License,
attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file
to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full license is found.
